# Workflow optimisation for reproducible science in ecology and environmental science

This serves as an open-access repository for the forthcoming lecture entitled 'Workflow Optimization for Reproducible Science in Ecology and Environmental Science,' scheduled to be hosted by the University of the Aegean on October 26, 2023. 

Within this repository, you can find all the course materials, references, and lecture handouts. Additionally, I envision this repository to serve as a practical demonstration of building and structuring a course from the ground up in an open and reproducible environment.
